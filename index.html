                    <p>2016-2019</p>
                    <p>This period at Casas Bahia made me develop as a professional, especially in the first few months, and when I realized I was already helping in practically all sectors of the store, from management to operational. I participated in customer service, sent credit analysis, issued invoices, collaborated on marketing campaigns, assisted with dismissal and admission processes, as well as with inventories and receipt of goods.<p>

                    <p>2020-2021</p>
                    <p>In almost 10 months at this company I was able to assist in sales, cash, logistics and marketing processes. In sales, I was responsible for: contacting customers and publicizing the company's offers, carrying out negotiations and quotations, and finalizing the sale, specifying deadlines and costs. In cash, I operated receipts and departures. Finally, in marketing, I created digital folders with information, campaigns and promotions. In addition, I also helped with delivery management.
